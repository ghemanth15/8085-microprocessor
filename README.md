# 8085 microprocessor
The miniproject is developed using C++. This project's objective is to find the number of units of time is being taken to execute an 8085 microprocessor program.

Before executing the program
1.Include mpj.txt file which contains all the opcodes
2.Include sample.txt which contains the input code for which the number of units of time must be calculated
3.Include 8085.cpp file since the entire code resides in this file

The code is being executed in DEV C++ or can use any IDE that can implement and run C++ programs.
